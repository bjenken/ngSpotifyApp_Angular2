# ngSpotify App

This app was created using tutorials from Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/learn-angular-2-development-by-building-10-apps/learn/v4/overview), with some minor changes. Since the creation of that tutorial series Spotify has changed their API structure so that all requests require token authorization. To remedy this a TokenService class can be found here that will allow the user to login to their Spotify account in order to use the application.
